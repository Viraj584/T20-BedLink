## 🚀 Project Overview

In critical medical emergencies, finding an available hospital bed with the right equipment (**ICU, Ventilator, Oxygen, Cardiac, Burns**) within minutes can mean the difference between life and death. Traditional telephone queries cause costly delays, stale bed data, and ambulance rerouting.

**BedLink** resolves this challenge with three interconnected modules:
1. **Emergency Hospital Bed Ranking & 2-Minute Hold System**: Uses real-time weighted algorithms to match patients with the nearest hospital based on specialty beds, travel time, data freshness, and capacity load. Includes an automated 2-minute bed hold with auto-cascade on rejection.
2. **10-Second Hospital Nurse Dashboard**: Allows nurses to update bed availability in one tap with minute-level freshness timestamps.
3. **Patient Healthcare Hub & AI Test Report Analyzer**: Empowers patients to search for emergency hospital beds or specialist clinics/pathology labs, and upload digital medical test reports (PDFs, images, or camera photos) for instant plain-English AI analysis powered by OpenRouter API (`google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`).

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🚑 1. Ambulance Dispatcher & Emergency Bed Ranking
- **Weighted Match Algorithm**: Ranks hospitals using a dynamic scoring formula factoring in distance, estimated driving time (OSRM API), bed type availability, capacity load penalty, and data freshness (staleness penalties for un-updated data).
- **2-Minute Bed Hold Protocol**: Upon requesting a bed, a 2-minute countdown timer holds the bed exclusively for the ambulance.
- **Auto-Cascade Fallback**: If a hospital rejects or times out, the system automatically redirects the request to the next highest-ranked hospital.
- **Live Turn-by-Turn Map Navigation**: Displays real-time ambulance routing to the destination hospital using Leaflet/OSRM maps.

### 🩺 2. Hospital Nurse 10-Second Dashboard
- **1-Tap Inventory Updates**: Nurses can update ICU, Ventilator, Oxygen, Cardiac, Burns, and General bed counts in under 10 seconds.
- **Data Freshness Tracker**: Displays live minutes since last update (e.g., "Updated 2m ago" vs. "Stale - Updated 55m ago").
- **Real-Time Request Alerts**: Audio & vibration alerts notify nurses of incoming emergency bed requests with approve/reject actions.
- **Request Audit History**: Tracks past approved, rejected, and timed-out requests.

### 🏥 3. Patient Healthcare Hub & Specialty Clinic Search
- **Dual Emergency Search Options**:
  - 🚑 **Emergency Hospital Beds**: Direct access to real-time ICU/Ventilator bed rankings.
  - 🔬 **Clinics & Pathology Labs**: Specialty filtering for non-emergency healthcare needs.
- **Multi-Specialty Filters**: Filter clinics by Dermatology (Skin), Pathology & Lab Tests, Gynecology, Dental, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, or General Physician.
- **Clinic Ranking Engine**: Ranks clinics by proximity, user rating, and consultation fees.

### 🧠 4. AI Digital Medical Test Report Analyzer
- **Multimodal Document Upload**: Pick digital PDFs, device gallery image scans, camera photos of paper reports, or pre-loaded realistic sample reports.
- **OpenRouter AI Vision Pipeline**: Uses OpenRouter API (`google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`) to read complex lab report markers (e.g., Low Hemoglobin, High TSH, Low SPO2, Troponin I, Skin Biopsy Dermatitis).
- **Patient-Friendly Plain English**: Converts medical jargon into non-technical, simple explanations with bulleted key findings.
- **Smart Healthcare Recommendations**:
  - 🚨 **Critical Emergency**: Recommends immediate Hospital Admission (ICU/Cardiac Ward).
  - 🟡 **Requires Attention**: Recommends specialist Clinic / Diagnostic Lab consultation.
  - 🟢 **Normal**: Indicates *"You are fit for now!"* with preventive health tips.
- **Local Fallback Rule Engine**: Seamlessly falls back to an offline rule engine if network connection or API key is unavailable.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Scope

### Limitations
- **API Rate Limits & Connectivity**: AI Vision analysis via OpenRouter relies on active internet access; if offline, the system seamlessly uses the local rule-based fallback engine.
- **OSRM Public Server Latency**: Public OSRM endpoints may occasionally introduce minor network latency during routing geometry requests.

### 🔮 Future Scope
- **IoT Ambulance Telemetry**: Real-time streaming of patient vital signs (ECG, SPO2, Blood Pressure) directly from ambulance equipment to receiving hospital ICUs.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**: Push notifications sent directly to nurse mobile devices even when the app is running in the background.
- **Hospital EHR Integration**: Direct synchronization with hospital Electronic Health Records (EHR) and HMS software via FHIR / HL7 APIs.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support for regional Indian languages (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, etc.) for non-English speaking patients.
